# Segmentation of Cell Cycles Images

It's known the association of differences in the rates of cellular division and differences in the amount of time spent in each stage of cellular division between healthy and cancer cells [1]. Therefore, it's essential to create methods to analyze images of a process as cell division.

We will explore the following dataset:

The input will be the nematode cells images in the dataset from Kaggle.

With these images, we will do the process of image segmentation to count the Nuclei and check if the cell cycle is in Mitosis or Interphase.

The output will be the segmentation mask for the Nuclei.
